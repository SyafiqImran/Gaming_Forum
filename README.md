# Project 2 - Gaming_Forum

Hi there , this is my attempt at making a Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). The theme that i choose was to make a gaming-themed forum.


Technologies that i used:-
For this project , the primary language was Ruby, the framework sinatra, Postgresql and little bit of HTML
Here is a list of gems that i used to complete the app
  gem 'sinatra'
  gem 'sinatra-contrib'
  gem 'pg'
  gem 'bcrypt'
  gem 'httparty'
  gem 'pry'

Approaches that i took in making the application.

For making these app, my thought process was to include a function where users will be able to upload a post and comment on that particular post.
Also , i have created it so that only the original poster can delete and edit either posts or comments .


Challenges that i faced in making the application.

I tried to include a like system for post/comments but the issue was there will be an error if there is no comments on the posts . Another common error is that i am unable to limit the number of likes to each user. This will also causes an error.

Another problem was i am unable to redirect the page to the respective post when the user finished commenting..

I consider this as a work in progress , so thanks for sharing your time.
